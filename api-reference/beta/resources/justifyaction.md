# justifyAction resource type

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The applyLabel, applyLabelFromClassification, or removeLabel APIs may return justifyACtion. The action instructs the consuming application that justification is required for the specific operation. Justification is provided via [labelingOptions](../resources/labelingoptions.md). The previous call should be repeated, but with the downgradeJustification property of `labelingOptions` set with a justification message, provided via user input or application logic.
