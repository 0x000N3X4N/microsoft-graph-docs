# Use the Microsoft Graph API for security threat detection and protection (preview)

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

The sophistication of security threats continues to escalate, affecting the global economy. Damage is often done long before organizations even discover it. You can use Microsoft Graph to build or extend security solutions that consolidate and correlate security alerts from multiple sources, detect threats that attempt to compromise user identity, unlock contextual data to inform investigations, and automate security operations for greater efficiency.

Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph brings together security intelligence from within Microsoft, security operations centers, and partners from around the world to form an ecosystem of integrated security solutions. Using machine learning, behavioral monitoring, and the scale of the cloud, the Intelligent Security Graph can better protect, detect, and respond to threats quickly and comprehensively. The [security API](security-api-overview.md) connects you to the [Intelligent Security Graph](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/intelligence-security-api), empowering you with solutions that are actionable and holistic.

Today's security breaches often begin with attackers gaining access to a user's identity in an environment. Having access to even a low-privileged user account makes it possible for attackers to gain access to important organization resources. The [identity protection API](identityprotection_root.md) in Microsoft Graph lets you [integrate with Azure Active Directory Identity Protection](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-identityprotection-graph-getting-started), and detect potential vulnerabilities affecting identities in your organization.
