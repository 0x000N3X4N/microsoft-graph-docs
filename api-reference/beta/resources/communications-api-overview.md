# Working with the Communications API in Microsoft Graph

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

The Microsoft Graph Communications APIs adds a new dimension to how you or your organization can interact with other users by enabling core communication capabilities and features in your apps and services. These APIs enables you to create and receive calls, create and retrieve meeting coordinates and check Userâ€™s Presence.
You can use these APIs to build service applications (Bots), that acts like participants in a call, that create and retrieve meetings on behalf of Users <!-- and to check presence availability and activity of users. -->
These APIs provide calling functionality as well as the ability to create and retrieve online meetings. You can use service applications (bots) with these APIs, where the bot can act as a participant in your VoIP calls or Teams meetings, for example.
