# Azure AD Entitlement Management

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) entitlement management can help you manage access to groups, applications, and SharePoint Online sites for internal users and also users outside your organization.

By creating access packages with the roles users need to have across those resources, and defining policies for who can request an access package and how long they can have an assignment to an access package, you can govern the lifecycle of access for both internal and external users.

The entitlement management resource types include:

- Access package
- Access package assignment policy
- Access package assignment request
- Access package assignment
- Access package catalog


Note that the entitlement management feature, including the API, is included in Azure AD Premium P2.  The tenant where entitlement management is being used must have a valid purchased or trial Azure AD Premium P2 or EMS E5 subscription.
