# Use the Microsoft Graph API to integrate social and workplace intelligence in an app

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

Microsoft Graph enables access to social and workplace data for people, and supports gestures in a user's social context.

## Aggregate and extract specific information about people

Use the [person](../resources/person.md) resource and the People API to aggregate information
about a person from across mail, contacts, and social networks. The results are ordered by their
relevance based on multiple communication, collaboration, and business relationships. The API
lets you browse, sort, select, filter, or search for persons based on your criteria.

- [List people](../api/user-list-people.md)

## Help users get the most relevant documents for their work

Use the insights API to identify the most relevant documents for a user: 

- List documents [trending around](../api/insights-list-trending.md) a user
- List documents [used by](../api/insights-list-used.md) a user
- List documents [shared with or shared by](../api/insights-list-shared.md) a user

## Help users keep track of all their activities in one place

The MyAnalytics app provides insight into how people spend their time and who they spend it with. This data can help people plan their day, gain insights into their different work patterns, and help them balance work and life.

The Analytics API enables you to synchronize or integrate people's data with a custom, third-party app to support a wide range of scenarios that can help improve user productivity and collaboration. For example, you could integrate MyAnalytics data with mobile device activities to help users keep track of all their work and social activities and plan their day all within one app.

The Analytics API includes the following two resources.

- [settings](../resources/settings.md): For the Analytics API to return results for users, their current settings must show they have a valid MyAnalytics license, be opted in to using MyAnalytics, and have a cloud-hosted mailbox thatâ€™s graph-enabled.
- [activityStatistics](../resources/activitystatistics.md): Gets all data (including metadata) for the past seven days (or the specified time range) for the Office 365 activities that users spent time on, including the number of hours spent on email, meetings, calls, and chats (instant messages) during and outside of working hours and the number of hours available for focused work.

## Manage @-Mentions

Calling out a recipient to notify and get the recipient's attention in a message is a common social gesture.
The [mention](../resources/mention.md) resource and the Mentions API provide a light-weight mechanism to call out
a recipient in a [message](../resources/message.md), get all the messages in which a user is notified using an @-mention,
or get each mention in a message.
