# cloudPcSelfServiceSettings resource type

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Currently, there is only one Cloud PC user setting, which is the self-service setting.
When self-service is enabled,  users can upgrade their Cloud PCs without needing to go back and forth with their IT administrator. As the IT admin, you can use the CloudPcSelfServiceSettings API to enable or disable self-service for specific user groups.
Every tenant has one self-service setting entity, where the ID property is your Azure AD tenant ID. The self service setting entity is created when you onboard your tenant to Cloud PC. This entity canâ€™t be deleted.
