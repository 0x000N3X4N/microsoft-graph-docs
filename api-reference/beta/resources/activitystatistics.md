# activityStatistics resource type

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The type of activities include meetings, emails, chats (instant messages), calls, and focus work. You can specify the startDate and endDate. If you donâ€™t specify a time range, activity statistics are returned for the last seven days by default.
