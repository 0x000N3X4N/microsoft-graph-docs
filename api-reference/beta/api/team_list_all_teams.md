# List all teams

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Retrieves all [groups](../resources/group.md) in the organization (tenant) that have corresponding [teams](../resources/team.md). 
Any group that has a team has a resourceProvisioningOptions property that contains "Team", 
so the approach is to get a [list of all groups](group_list.md) where resourceProvisioningOptions contains "Team".

See [list of all groups](group_list.md) for information on permissions and responses.

Note: Teams that were deleted then restored may not be included, Microsoft is working to address this limitation.

## Example
#### Request
The following is an example of the request.
<!-- {
  "blockType": "request",
  "name": "get_groups"
}-->
```http
GET /groups?$filter=resourceProvisioningOptions/Any(x:x eq 'Team')
```

#### Response
The following is an example of the response.
>**Note:**Â The response object shown here might be shortened for readability. The [default properties](../api/group_get.md#default-properties) will be returned from an actual call.
