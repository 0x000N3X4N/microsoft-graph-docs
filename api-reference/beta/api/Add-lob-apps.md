# Microsoft Teams API - Tenant Application Management
A Global Administrator will use cmdlets to create/update/remove tenant apps for the Teams tenant app catalog. Each cmdlet will talk to an MSGraph endpoint which will proxy the calls to MiddleTier. The MSGraph endpoints will be responsible for authentication and passing along the tokens to MiddleTier along with the user supplied app payload.

#### Description
Publish an app to the organization's catalog(aka Tenant app catalog).

#### Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. Only Global Administrators can call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference).
