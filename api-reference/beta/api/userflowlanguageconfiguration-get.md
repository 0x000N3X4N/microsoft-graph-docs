# Get userFlowLanguageConfiguration

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Read the properties and relationships of a [userFlowLanguageConfiguration](../resources/userflowlanguageconfiguration.md) object. These objects represent a language available in a user flow.

**Note:** To retrieve a language supported for customization, you must first enable language customization on your B2C user flow. See the [Update b2cIdentityUserFlow](../api/b2cidentityuserflow-update.md) topic for an example. Language customization is enabled by default in [Azure Active Directory user flows](../resources/b2xidentityuserflow.md).
