# Update subscription

Renew a subscription by extending its expiry time.

Subscriptions expire after a length of time that varies by resource type. In order to avoid missing notifications, an app should renew its subscriptions well in advance of their expiry date. See [subscription](../resources/subscription.md) for maximum length of a subscription for each resource type.

## Permissions

Depending on the resource and the permission type (delegated or application) requested, the permission specified in the following table is the least privileged required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](/graph/permissions-reference).

| Supported resource | Delegated (work or school account) | Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Application |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|[contact](../resources/contact.md) | Contacts.Read | Contacts.Read | Contacts.Read |
|[drive](../resources/drive.md) (user's OneDrive) | Files.ReadWrite | Files.ReadWrite | Files.ReadWrite.All |
|[drive](../resources/drive.md) (SharePoint shared content and drive) | Files.ReadWrite.All | Not supported | Files.ReadWrite.All |
|[event](../resources/event.md) | Calendars.Read | Calendars.Read | Calendars.Read |
|[group](../resources/group.md) | Group.Read.All | Not supported | Group.Read.All |
|[group conversation](../resources/conversation.md) | Group.Read.All | Not supported | Not supported |
|[message](../resources/message.md) | Mail.Read | Mail.Read | Mail.Read |
|[security alert](../resources/alert.md) | SecurityEvents.ReadWrite.All | Not supported | SecurityEvents.ReadWrite.All |
|[user](../resources/user.md) | User.Read.All | User.Read.All | User.Read.All |

> **Note:** There are additional permission limitations for subscriptions on OneDrive drives and Outlook items. The limitations apply to subscribing, as well as getting, updating, and deleting the subscriptions.

- You cannot use application permissions to subscribe to change notifications on _root items_ in a OneDrive **drive**.

- To subscribe to change notifications of Outlook contacts, events, or messages in _shared or delegated_ folders:

  - Use the corresponding application permission to subscribe to changes of items in any user's folders and mailbox in the tenant.
  - Do not use the Outlook sharing permissions (Contacts.Read.Shared, Calendars.Read.Shared, Mail.Read.Shared, and their read/write counterparts), as they do **not** support subscribing to change notifications on items in shared or delegated folders. 
  - And, delegated permission supports subscribing to items in folders in only the signed-in user's mailbox.
