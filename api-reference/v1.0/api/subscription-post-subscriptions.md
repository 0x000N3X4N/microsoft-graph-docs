In addition to selecting permissions, the following information should be considered: 

- The ChannelMessage.Read.Group uses [resource-specific consent](https://aka.ms/teams-rsc).
- **chatMessage** subscriptions with application permissions include resource data, and require [encryption](/graph/webhooks-with-resource-data). Subscription creation will fail if [encryptionCertificate](../resources/subscription.md) is not specified. Before creating a **chatMessage** subscription, you must request access. For details, see [Protected APIs in Microsoft Teams](/graph/teams-protected-apis). 
- `/teams/getAllMessages` and `/chats/getAllMessages` are available to users that have the [required licenses](https://aka.ms/teams-changenotification-licenses).
- `/chats/getAllMessages` only returns messages from chats owned by the tenant. 
If a chat thread is initiated by a user outside the tenant, that chat thread is not owned by the tenant, and does not create change notifications.
- Additional limitations apply for subscriptions on OneDrive items. The limitations apply to creating as well as managing (getting, updating, and deleting) subscriptions. On a personal OneDrive, you can subscribe to the root folder or any subfolder in that drive. On OneDrive for Business, you can subscribe to only the root folder. Change notifications are sent for the requested types of changes on the subscribed folder, or any file, folder, or other **driveItem** instances in its hierarchy. You cannot subscribe to **drive** or **driveItem** instances that are not folders, such as individual files.
- Additional limitations apply for subscriptions on Outlook items. The limitations apply to creating as well as managing (getting, updating, and deleting) subscriptions.
    - Delegated permission supports subscribing to items in folders in only the signed-in user's mailbox. For example, you cannot use the delegated permission Calendars.Read to subscribe to events in another userâ€™s mailbox.
    - To subscribe to change notifications of Outlook contacts, events, or messages in _shared or delegated_ folders:
        - Use the corresponding application permission to subscribe to changes of items in a folder or mailbox of _any_ user in the tenant.
        - Do not use the Outlook sharing permissions (Contacts.Read.Shared, Calendars.Read.Shared, Mail.Read.Shared, and their read/write counterparts), as they do **not** support subscribing to change notifications on items in shared or delegated folders.

In the request body, supply a JSON representation of the [subscription](../resources/subscription.md) object.
The `clientState` and `latestSupportedTlsVersion` fields are optional.

##### Resources examples

The following are valid values for the resource property of the subscription:

| Resource type | Examples |
|:------ |:----- |
|[Call records](../resources/callrecords-callrecord.md)|`communications/callRecords`|
|[Chat message](../resources/chatmessage.md) | `chats/{id}/messages`, `chats/getAllMessages`, `teams/{id}/channels/{id}/messages`, `teams/getAllMessages` |
|[Contacts](../resources/contact.md)|`me/contacts`|
|[Conversations](../resources/conversation.md)|`groups('{id}')/conversations`|
|[Drives](../resources/driveitem.md)|`me/drive/root`|
|[Events](../resources/event.md)|`me/events`|
|[Groups](../resources/group.md)|`groups`|
|[List](../resources/list.md)|`sites/{site-id}/lists/{list-id}`|
|[Mail](../resources/message.md)|`me/mailfolders('inbox')/messages`, `me/messages`|
|[Users](../resources/user.md)|`users`|
|[Security alert](../resources/alert.md)|`security/alerts?$filter=status eq 'New'`|

> **Note:** Any path starting with `me` can also be used with `users/{id}` instead of `me` to target a specific user instead of the current user.

##### Response

Here is an example of the response. Note: The response object shown here may be truncated for brevity. All of the properties will be returned from an actual call.
<!-- {
  "blockType": "response",

  "@odata.type": "microsoft.graph.subscription"

}
```

## Notification endpoint validation

The subscription notification endpoint (specified in the `notificationUrl` property) must be capable of responding to a validation request as described in [Set up notifications for changes in user data](/graph/webhooks#notification-endpoint-validation). If validation fails, the request to create the subscription returns a 400 Bad Request error.
