# Update printJob
Namespace: microsoft.graph

Update the [configuration](../resources/printjobconfiguration.md) property of a [print job](../resources/printjob.md).

Updating a print job configuration will only succeed if there is a [printTask](../resources/printTask.md) in `processing` state on the associated print job, started by a trigger that requesting app created. For details about how to register a task trigger, see [Extending Universal Print to support pull printing](/graph/universal-print-concept-overview#extending-universal-print-to-support-pull-printing).
