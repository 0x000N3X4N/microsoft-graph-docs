## Permissions

Choose one of the following least privileged permissions to call this method. If necessary, you can consider other possible permissions that have a higher privilege. For more information, see [User permissions](/graph/permissions-reference#user-permissions).

| Permission type | Least privileged permission | Other possible permissions |
|:--------------- |:----------------------------- |:-------------------------- |
| Delegated (work or school account) | User.ReadWrite | User.ReadWrite.All, User.ManageIdentities.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | User.ReadWrite | None |
| Application | User.ReadWrite.All | User.ManageIdentities.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

The following list defines exceptions to the permissions in the previous table:
- When updating the **passwordProfile** property, the Directory.AccessAsUser.All permission is required.
- Updating another user's **businessPhones**, **mobilePhone**, or **otherMails** property is only allowed on users who are non-administrators or assigned one of the following roles: Directory Readers, Guest Inviter, Message Center Reader, and Reports Reader. For more information, see Helpdesk (Password) Administrator in [Azure AD available roles](/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#available-roles).
- Updating the **identities** property requires the User.ManageIdentities.All permission.
