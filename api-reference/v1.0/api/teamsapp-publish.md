# Publish apps to your organization's app catalog

Namespace: microsoft.graph

Publish an [app](../resources/teamsapp.md) to the Microsoft Teams apps catalog.
Specifically, this API publishes the app to your organization's catalog (the tenant app catalog);
the created resource will have `distributionMethod` = `organization`.

## Permissions

One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/docs/concepts/permissions_reference).

| Permission Type                        | Permissions (from least to most privileged)|
|:----------------------------------     |:-------------|
| Delegated (work or school account)     | AppCatalog.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |
| Delegated (work or school account) | App.Catalog.Submit </br>Allows an app to submit apps to the organization's app catalog as well as cancel past submissions that have not been published.</br> &#119821;&#119822;&#119827;&#119812;: non-admin users can submit apps for review by including the  `requiresReview=true` query parameter during submissions. |
| Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported|
| Application                            | Not supported. |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /appCatalogs/teamsApps
```

```http
POST /appCatalogs/teamsApps?requiresReview:{boolean}
```

> [!NOTE]
> This API consumes a Teams app package zip file as the request body and uploads a new Teams app to the organization's app catalog.

## Optional query parameter

|Property|Type|Description|
|----|----|----|
|requiresReview| boolean | This optional query parameter triggers the app review process.  Whether a user can submit an app without triggering the review process is determined by role. If a user with admin privileges does not set `requiresReview` or it is set to `false`, the app will be considered approved and will instantly publish.|

## Request headers

| Header        | Value           |
|:--------------|:--------------  |
| Authorization | Bearer {token}. Required.  |
| Content-Type  | application/zip |

## Request body

Teams Zip Manifest Payload.
For Teams application zip file [see Create an app package](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/apps/apps-package).
You can't create an app for an organization that has the same manifest ID as another app in that organization.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and a [teamsCatalogApp](../resources/teamsapp.md) object.
