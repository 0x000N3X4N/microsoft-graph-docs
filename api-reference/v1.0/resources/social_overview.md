# People overview

Microsoft Graph provides access to useful people and social data.

You can use the [person](../resources/person.md) resource and the People API to aggregate information 
about a person from across mail, contacts, and social networks. The results are ordered by their 
relevance based on mutliple communication, collaboration, and business relationships. The API
lets you browse, sort, select, filter, or search for persons based on your criteria.
