# Microsoft Search query API overview (preview) 

Microsoft Search has introduced new organizational search experiences into the applications customers use every day.
The vision is to harness the collective knowledge of your organization in Search and surface relevant content to keep end users up to date and leverage the work of others.  Search is available in the different experiences such as in Office, SharePoint, Delve, Windows and Bing.

## Why use the Microsoft Search API?

Microsoft Search query API in Graph provides a unified search endpoint to search across your data. It brings search features to app developers, enabling them to build custom search experience.

### Relevance powered by the Microsoft Graph

With Microsoft Search, you benefit from the latest improvements on relevance. The Search query API will expose this relevance in your own app, and therefore make it consistent with how search results show up in Office applications.

### Access new data types from your app

New data types are being introduced in graph (in particular with Connectors) <!---Link Todo link to Connectors Concept )--> . The universal search query endpoint will expose these new data types.
