# Microsoft Graph SDKs Overview

The Microsoft Graph SDKs are designed to simplify building high quality, efficient and resilient applications that access Microsoft Graph. There are two components to the SDKs, a service library and a core library.

The service library contains models and request builders that are generated from Microsoft Graph metadata to provide a rich, strongly typed and discoverable experience when working with the many datasets available on Microsoft Graph.

The core library provide a set of features that enhance working with all the services of the Graph.  Embedded support for retry handling, secure redirects, transparent authentication and payload compression, improve the quality of your application's interactions with Microsoft Graph with no added complexity to your application code but while still leaving you completely in control.  The core library also provides support for common tasks such as paging through collections and creating batch requests.

## Useful Links

The SDK [design requirements documentation](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/msgraph-sdk-design) provides more details on the features and capabilities of the SDK. Request or vote on additional features at the [Microsoft Graph UserVoice](https://microsoftgraph.uservoice.com) site.

## Developer Tenant

When building applications with Microsoft Graph we recommend you create a developer tenant by signing up for the [Office Developer Program](http://aka.ms/OfficeDevProgram).
