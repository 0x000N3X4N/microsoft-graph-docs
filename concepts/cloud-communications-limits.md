# Limits to Cloud Communications APIs in Microsoft Graph

We set limits on API usage to ensure that our platform is stable, reliable, and secure. They are *subject to change* in the future. 

>**Note:** Once the limit is reached, attempting to make more API requests will result in a `429 Error`.

| API      | Limitations    |
| :------------- | :----------: |
|  Calls | 10,000 calls/month and 100 calls/month   |
| Meetings   | 2000 requests/user |
| Presence (preview)   | 2 requests/second |
