# Microsoft Graph Reports API overview

Usage reports in the Office 365 admin center enable admins to understand their company's usage across the Office 365 services.

## Why use the Microsoft Graph Reports API to integrate with your company's usage reporting solution?

Many of you have existing reporting solutions such as a company reporting application or a web portal in place. To assure that you can monitor your IT services in one unified location, the usage reporting APIs complement the usage reports and allow organizations and independent software vendors to incorporate Office 365 usage data into their existing reporting solutions. Using these APIs, you can retrieve the data available in all of the usage reports, including organization level summaries per service, entity level (user, sites, accounts) usage information for reporting periods of the last 7/30/90/180 days, and daily activity aggregates.  This gives you the option to keep historical usage information for as long as it is required.
