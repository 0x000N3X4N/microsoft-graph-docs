# Step 3: Deploy, test, and extend

// TODO: Rewrite to include the step 3 content



1.  **Test throughly**

    Once you've updated your app, test it thoroughly to verify that it works as it did and that it doesn't contain new bugs.  

    Be sure to use multiple environments, data sets, and end-user personas, e.g. credentials with different roles, rights, and responsibilities.

1.  **Deploy staged updates**

    Consider deploying your updates in stages.  A limited roll-out to a small set of friendly users can help identify glitches and other potentially-embarrassing issues.  This also gives you a change to monitor initial reception and feedback.

    If the initial roll-out goes well, monitor progress as you deploy to larger audiences.

1.  **Explore new value**

    Once your app is updated to Microsoft Graph API, continue exploring the API and supported services. New features and capabilities are introduced regularly.  

    - The What's New (thingie) provides a high-level introduction to major changes

    - The (foo) blog provides more detailed introductions.

    - The Changelog summarizes specific document updates.

    Following these updates to help you identify new ways to add value to your apps and to improve the experiences of your users.  

## Example - ??

_TODO: Develop comparative examples showing 1) a simple (search-and-replace) example and 2) a slightly more complex example (tenantDetail versus organization?)_
