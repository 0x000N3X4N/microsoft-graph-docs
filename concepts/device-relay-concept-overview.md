# Using the device replay API in Microsoft Graph (preview)

Nowadays people have multiple devices they interact with on a daily basis. Furthermore, many of today's productivity tasks and entertainment activities are started on one device and continued on another. To meet your customers' needs, your apps need to seamlessly span devices and platforms. 
The Device Relay APIs enable app developers to deliver seamless experiences to their users by making it possible for them to actively transfer an experience from one device to another or enhance it by using multiple devices at once. This is done via in-app actions (e.g. a button or selection in your app) that call the Device Relay APIs to discover the user's devices, and enables him/her to launch and message your app on those other devices.

## Why integrate with device relay?
### Empower your users to make the most of their experience with your app by launching it on other devices and enable cross-device messaging
Device Relay enables your app to register itself, and discover, command, and message your app on the user's devices. By doing this you can make the tasks your customers work on the central focus. They can work on the device that is most convenient for them by discovering it and transferring tasks to it. They can also enhance an ongoing experience with your app by using other devices around them.

You can use Device Relay for companion devices, or remote control scenarios. Use the messaging capabilities to create an app channel between two devices to send and receive custom messages. For example, you can enable your customers to use their phone to control playback on a TV. You could also provide a companion app in a productivity scenario by displaying context-based commonly used actions on a phone while your users works on the main view of your app in the PC.

Your customers can also actively transfer an experience from one device to another by performing an action in your app. For example, a user might be watching a live broadcast on her phone while on the bus, but when she gets home she wants to transfer playback to the PC in her living room. Productivity scenarios are also supported by Device Relay. For example, your customer might be processing a customer order on her phone and as she walks into her office she can easily transfer the in-progress entry to the PC and finish the task there.
