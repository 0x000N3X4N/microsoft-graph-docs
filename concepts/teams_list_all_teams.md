# List all teams in Microsoft Teams for an organization (preview)

To list all [teams](../api-reference/beta/resources/team.md) in Microsoft Teams for organization (tenant), 
get a list of all [groups](../api-reference/beta/resources/group.md) in the organization that have corresponding teams. 
Any group that has a team has a **resourceProvisioningOptions** property that contains "Team". The approach is to get a [list of all groups](../api-reference/beta/api/group_list.md) where **resourceProvisioningOptions** contains "Team".

>**Note:** The **Group.resourceProvisioningOptions** property can be changed.
Do not add or remove "Team" from that collection;  
otherwise, you'll get incorrect results when you list all teams.

> **Note**: Certain unused old teams aren't listed with this approach. For details, see [known issues](../concepts/known_issues.md#missing-teams-in-list-all-teams).
