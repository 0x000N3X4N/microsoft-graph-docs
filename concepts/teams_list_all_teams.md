# List all teams in organization

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

To list all [teams](../api-reference/beta/resources/team.md) in an organization (tenant), 
get a list of all [groups](../api-reference/beta/resources/group.md) in the organization that have corresponding teams. 
Any group that has a team has a resourceProvisioningOptions property that contains "Team", 
so the approach is to get a [list of all groups](../api-reference/beta/api/group_list.md) where resourceProvisioningOptions contains "Team".

Note: The Group.resourceProvisioningOptions can be changed.
Do not add or remove "Team" from that collection, 
otherwise list all teams will return incorrect results.

> **Note**: There is a known issue with certain unused old teams not being listed with this approach. For details, see the [known issues list](../concepts/known_issues.md#missing-teams-in-list-all-teams).
