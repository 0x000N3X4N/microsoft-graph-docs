# Overview of Compliance in Microsoft Graph

The Microsoft Graph APIs for Compliance provide functionality for organizations to automate repetitive tasks and integrate with their existing compliance tools to build predictable workflows that are often required to meet industry regulations.

## Develop applications that ensure a repeatable, predictable, and standard process

Organizations rely on Microsoft 365 eDiscovery capabilities to meet requirements to find the truth about what happened in their organization when they need to, based on internal or external requirements such as litigation, investigation, or regulatory compliance.

### Manage your eDiscovery workflows

Many organizations execute a high volume of cases and eDiscovery requests and would prefer to automate some tasks. The new Microsoft Graph APIs for Advanced eDiscovery now provide API access to most functions available within the Advanced eDiscovery solution.
