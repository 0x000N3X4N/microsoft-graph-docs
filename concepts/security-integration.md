# Security solution Integrations using the Microsoft Graph Security API

You can connect with the Microsoft Graph Security API using any of the following options. This enables you to work with data in a unified format across [these supported Microsoft and partner security providers](https://aka.ms/graphsecurityalerts) via a single integration.

1. **Directly using the supported integration options** – Refer to the [list of supported integration options](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/security-concept-overview#why-use-the-microsoft-graph-security-api) like writing code to directly connect your application to derive rich insights. Leverage [samples](https://aka.ms/graphsecurityapicode) to get started.
2. **Use native integrations and connectors built by Microsoft partners** – Refer to the [Microsoft Graph Security API partner solutions](https://aka.ms/graphsecuritypartnerships) to use these integrations.  
3. **Use connectors built by Microsoft** – Refer to the [list of connectors](https://aka.ms/graphsecuritysolutionsconnectors) below that you can use to connect with the API through a variety of solutions for Security Incident and Management (SIEM), Security Response and Orchestration (SOAR), Incident Tracking and Service Management (ITSM),  reporting, etc.
