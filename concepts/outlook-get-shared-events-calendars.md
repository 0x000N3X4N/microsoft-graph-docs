# Get Outlook events in a shared or delegated calendar

In Outlook, a calendar owner can share a calendar with other users and let them view or modify events in that calendar; the calendar can be a custom calendar or the primary calendar. The owner can also grant a delegate to act on their behalf, to receive or respond to meeting requests, or create or change items in the primary calendar of the email account.

Programmatically, Microsoft Graph supports reading and writing events in calendars that have been shared by other users, as well as reading the shared calendars. The support also applies to calendars that have been delegated. The rest of this article describes reading events in a shared or delegated calendar. For creating events, refer to [Create Outlook events in a shared or delegated calendar](outlook-create-event-in-shared-delegated-calendar.md).

The examples below use this scenario: in Outlook, Alex has shared his primary calendar with Megan and given Megan read permission. If Megan signs into your app and provides _delegated permissions_ (Calendars.Read.Shared or Calendars.ReadWrite.Shared), on behalf of Megan, your app can specify Alex' ID and the `calendar` shortcut to access Alex' primary calendar and its events.

> **Note** The sharing permissions (Calendars.Read.Shared or Calendars.ReadWrite.Shared) allow you to read or write events in a shared or delegated calendar. They do not support [subscribing to change notifications](webhooks.md) on items in such folders. To set up change notification subscriptions on events in a shared, delegated, or any other user or resource calendar in the tenant, use the application permission, Calendars.Read.

## Get an event in the shared, primary calendar

Signed in as Megan, your app can get a specific event in the primary calendar that Alex has shared with Megan:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{Alex-userId | Alex-userPrincipalName}/calendar/events/{id}
```

On successful completion, you'll get HTTP 200 OK and the [event](/graph/api/resources/event?view=graph-rest-1.0) instance identified by `{id}` from Alex' primary calendar.

## Get all the events in the shared, primary calendar

Signed in as Megan, get all the events in the primary calendar that Alex has shared with Megan:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{Alex-userId | Alex-userPrincipalName}/calendar/events
```

On successful completion, you'll get HTTP 200 OK and a collection of [event](/graph/api/resources/event?view=graph-rest-1.0) instances in Alex' primary calendar.

## Get the shared, primary calendar

Signed in as Megan, get the primary calendar that Alex has shared with Megan:

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{Alex-userId | Alex-userPrincipalName}/calendar
```

On successful completion, you'll get HTTP 200 OK and a [calendar](/graph/api/resources/calendar?view=graph-rest-1.0) instance that represents Alex' shared, primary calendar.

The same GET capabilities apply if Alex has delegated Megan access to Alex' primary calendar, or if Alex has delegated Megan his entire mailbox.

If Alex has not shared his primary calendar with Megan, nor has he delegated his primary calendar or mailbox to Megan, specifying Alexâ€™s user ID or user principal name in the preceding GET operations will return an error. 


## Get events or calendar in shared, custom calendar

If Alex has shared a _custom_ calendar (as an example, a calendar named "Kids parties") with Adele, and Adele has provided delegated permissions (Calendars.Read or Calendars.ReadWrite), your app can get the events or calendar as if the shared calendar is one of Adele's calendars, as described below.

1. Signed in as Adele, use either the following requests to get all the calendars that Adele has access to, in order to get the ID of the shared custom calendar.

    ```http
    GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/calendars
    GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{Adele-userId | Adele-userPrincipalName}/calendars
    ```

    The shared calendar ("Kids parties") is the second calendar returned in the response.

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-type: application/json

    {
        "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users('d3b9214b-dd8b-441d-b7dc-c446c9fa0e69')/calendars",
        "value": [
            {
                "id": "AQMkADU5NAAAJMjAAAAA==",
                "name": "Calendar",
                "color": "auto",
                "changeKey": "NDznl+Uh50WkanaCOKHkaQAAAAACXQ==",
                "canShare": true,
                "canViewPrivateItems": true,
                "canEdit": true,
                "owner": {
                    "name": "Adele Vance",
                    "address": "AdeleV@contoso.OnMicrosoft.com"
                }
            },
            {
                "id": "AAMkADU5NGAAA0POeX5SHnRaRqdoI4oeRpAABf0JlyAAA=",
                "name": "Kids parties",
                "color": "lightYellow",
                "changeKey": "NDznl+Uh50WkanaCOKHkaQAAYumJRQ==",
                "canShare": false,
                "canViewPrivateItems": false,
                "canEdit": false,
                "owner": {
                    "name": "Alex Wilber",
                    "address": "AlexW@contoso.OnMicrosoft.com"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
```
2. On behalf of Adele, get one or more events, or the shared calendar using the second calendar ID in the response from step 1.

    ```http
    GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/calendars/AAMkADU5NGAAA0POeX5SHnRaRqdoI4oeRpAABf0JlyAAA=/events/{id}
    GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{Adele-userId | Adele-userPrincipalName}/calendars/AAMkADU5NGAAA0POeX5SHnRaRqdoI4oeRpAABf0JlyAAA=/events/{id}

    GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/calendars/AAMkADU5NGAAA0POeX5SHnRaRqdoI4oeRpAABf0JlyAAA=/events
    GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{Adele-userId | Adele-userPrincipalName}/calendars/AAMkADU5NGAAA0POeX5SHnRaRqdoI4oeRpAABf0JlyAAA=/events
    
    GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/calendars/AAMkADU5NGAAA0POeX5SHnRaRqdoI4oeRpAABf0JlyAAA=
    GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{Adele-userId | Adele-userPrincipalName}/calendars/AAMkADU5NGAAA0POeX5SHnRaRqdoI4oeRpAABf0JlyAAA=
    ```

On successful completion, you'll get HTTP 200 OK and the requested event, events, or calendar that Alex has shared with Adele.
