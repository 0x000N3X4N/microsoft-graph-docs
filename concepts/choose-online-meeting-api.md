# Choose an API in Microsoft Graph to create and join online meetings

You can choose from two APIs in Microsoft Graph to arrange and join online meetings:

- Calendar API: use the [event](/graph/api/resources/event) resource.
- Cloud communications API: use the [onlineMeeting](/graph/api/resources/onlineMeeting) resource.

Both approaches support online meetings on Microsoft Teams or Skype. 

Choose the calendar API for a convenient, streamlined integration with Outlook calendar:
- Programmatic support:
  - Directly create or update an event as an online meeting in the Outlook calendar, inserting a join-Teams-meeting blob in the Outlook calendar event.
  - Provide properties for joining meeting over the Internet or by dialing in.
- The resultant event provides full parity attendee UI experience, as in any event created through the Outlook calendar UI:
  - Attendees can choose to meet online or in person.
  - Attendees can click in the join-Teams-meeting blob in the Outlook calendar event, to join meeting over the Internet or by dialing in.
  - Attendees can assume rich features of Teams, including video conferencing and meeting lobby.

Choose the cloud communications API if your scenario calls for programmatic support of one or more of the following capabilities:
- Integrating the online meeting information with line of business or other apps, in addition to Outlook calendar.
- The flexibility to meet online instantly without scheduling on a calendar.
- Locale-based join information (preview).
- Joining meeting over the Internet or by dialing in.
- Video-conferencing.
- Additional security features such as meeting lobby and automating attendee admission (preview).
- Associating meeting with a Microsoft Teams chat.

The following table details the differences at the API level. 


| Online meeting feature | Calendar API (event resource) | Cloud communication API (onlineMeeting resource)             |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------
| Integration with a calendar item | Use the **isOnlineMeeting** and **onlineMeetingProvider** properties of an Outlook calendar [event](/graph/api/resources/event). <br> Automatically integrates with an Outlook calendar **event** when [creating](/graph/api/user-post-events) the event or [updating](/graph/api/event-update) it as an online meeting.<br> | [Online meeting information](/graph/api/resources/onlinemeetinginfo) is accessible independent of a particular calendar type. <br> [Create](/graph/api/application-post-onlinemeetings) an online meeting, then explicitly copy and make the online meeting information available in an Outlook calendar event or other calendars. <br> Available in preview: [createOrGet](/graph/api/onlinemeeting-createorget?view=graph-rest-beta) an online meeting, and use the returned **externalId** property to streamline embedding the resultant meeting in a third-party calendar. |
| Meeting ad hoc | Always schedules the online meeting for the specified **event** start and end times, but the [online meeting information](/graph/api/resources/onlinemeetinginfo) in **onlineMeeting** is valid for use outside of the scheduled meeting time.| Through the **onlineMeeting** property, access **joinWebUrl** to start an ad hoc meeting that starts instantly.<br> Flexible for meeting ad hoc without having to set **startDateTime** and **endDateTime** of **onlineMeeting**. |
| Locale-based join information | No direct API integration. | Use the `Accept-Language` HTTP header (preview) when creating an online meeting. <br> See [example](/graph/api/application-post-onlinemeetings?view=graph-rest-beta#example-2-create-an-online-meeting-with-user-token). |
| Joining over Internet (VoIP) | Through the **onlineMeeting** property, access **joinUrl**.  | Use the **joinWebUrl** property. |
| Joining by dial-in | Through the **onlineMeeting** property, access: <br> **conferenceId**, **quickDial**, **phones**, **tollFreeNumbers**, **tollNumber**. | Through the **audioConferencing** property, access: <br> - **conferenceId**, **tollFreeNumber**, **tollNumber**.<br> - Use the **dialinUrl** property for an externally-accessible web page that contains dial-in info to facilitate integration with third-party apps. |
| Joining by video conferencing (audio and video) | No direct API integration. | Use the **videoTeleconferenceId** property. |
| Meeting lobby and automating attendee admission into online meeting | No direct API integration.<br> In the injected join-Teams-meeting blob of the event, attendee can click **Meeting options** link to access meeting lobby, if enabled by the administrator. |  Use the **autoAdmittedUsers** property (preview).<br> Differentiates users from the organizerâ€™s company and federated companies, and other users including anonymous users.  |
