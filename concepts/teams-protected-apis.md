# Protected APIs in Microsoft Teams

Protected APIs deal with very sensitive data, and apps accessing that data need additional validation (above and beyond permission scopes & consent). 
These APIs include [reading channel and chat messages](/graph/api/channel-list-messages?view=graph-rest-beta) 
using [application permissions](/graph/auth/auth-concepts#microsoft-graph-permissions). 

To apply for access to protected APIs, please apply at [aka.ms/teamsgraph/requestaccess](http://aka.ms/teamsgraph/requestaccess). 
Access requests are looked at weekly. 
For information that doesn't fit in the form, please contact [teamsAppPerms@microsoft.com](mailto:teamsAppPerms@microsoft.com).
