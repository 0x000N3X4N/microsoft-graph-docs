Modern applications today are typically enhanced with location awareness to help provide intelligent context. This helps the user navigate to a place or allows the application to consider a user's location as part of their solution. The Places API provides rich detail on locations such as rooms or room lists to enable these sort of scenarios.

### Help customers stay synchronized and navigate their day

Add locations to your calendar and help customers navigate their day and enhance productivity.
