# Service Side Integration

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../api-reference/includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

## Create and send a notification from your app service

You can now create and send a notification that is targeted to a user using Microsoft Graph. The notification will be stored in the activity feed store and sent to all app clients on all device endpoints that the target user is signed-in to. See below to learn how to authenticate, required permission scopes, request header/body and expected response.

## Authentication

Currently, Microsoft Graph notifications requires that your application service use an On-Behalf-Of (OBO)Â authentication flow to post a notification to a user. This flow will work as follows:

1.  First, your user signs-into your application with their MSA or Azure AD account. When signing-in, the identity service will give you an access token.

2.  Next, you will send this access token to your app service.

3.  You app service will authenticate itself against the Identity service (MSA/Azure AD) and request an OBO token for Microsoft Graph notifications.

4.  Identity service will return an OBO based access token and refresh token. Subsequently, your app service can use this access token to post notifications to this user.

To learn more about OAuth 2.0 OBO flow, visit [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/v1-oauth2-on-behalf-of-flow). For details on how this flow works with Microsoft Graph notifications, please refer to our sample code available [here](https://aka.ms/gnsample-appservice).

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft Graph notifications currently uses OBO authentication flow with future plans to simplify this authentication further and eliminate the need to maintain access tokens and refresh tokens.
