# Cross-device experiences in Microsoft Graph

## Why invest in cross-device experiences?
Today we live in a **multi-device** world, and the way we use them spans different platforms and form factors: We read the morning news on our tablets, check email during the morning commute on our phones and use our desktop PCs when at work. At night, we watch movies on our home media consoles and use smart speakers to catch up on news from the day. The average customer engages with multiple devices & platforms throughout the day. 

In the past, form factor drove distinct types of behavior differences among consumers. However, this is no longer the case as multi-device consumers conduct all their activities across all their devices. The tasks we perform on a daily basis (whether at home with family, or at work with colleagues) are not inherently device-centric, but rather **human-centric**. Consumers *want* to be able to use whatever screen is available independent of where the input comes from. In reality, they often find each device has a clear boundary and getting things done across devices requires unnatural actions such as sending oneself an email or using USB sticks. Customers see friction when moving between their devices and sometimes important tasks get lost because of this context switching. Developers also suffer due to all this context switching, because when customers feel friction using an app customer engagement with the app goes down.

Microsoft is building a platform for creating experiences that transcend a single device so they can harmonize across devices – empowering a developer to create **human-centric** scenarios that move with the user and blur the lines between their devices regardless of form factor or platform. Microsoft Graph has provided a single unified endpoint to allow developers access data from Azure Active Directory & Office 365. Now through Microsoft Graph, developers can also access the activities and devices that belong to their customers, and enable rich human-centric experiences that cross devices and platforms. 

## Let customers pick up where they leave off with the activity feed API 
With activities, developers have a way to capture the unique tasks for users of their app which flow seamlessly across any platform and device, allowing them to quickly resume working on their preferred screen. Using the activity feed, developers can create a human-centric view of the tasks most important to users helping reduce friction when switching from web to mobile to PC and beyond. 

## Build rich cross-device experiences by using the device relay API 
In addition to Microsoft devices (PCs, Windows Phones, Xbox, IoT, HoloLens, etc.), the device graph also exposes Android and iOS devices. This enables developers to truly break down boundaries between their users' devices. Developers can build apps that leverage the user’s environment and create rich experiences that transcend a single device in real-time. 

### Deliver *human-centric* experiences by helping your users move easily across all their devices with Microsoft Graph 
Recently there has been a dramatic shift in the way users use their devices. Rather than substituting new devices, users are using additional form factors like phones and tablets, alongside their PCs.
