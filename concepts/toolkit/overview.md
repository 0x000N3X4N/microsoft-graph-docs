# Microsoft Graph Toolkit

    **Cut Development Time**

    All of the work to connect to Microsoft Graph, query the APIs, and render the data in a UI that looks and feels like a Microsoft365 experience is already done, with no customization required from the developer. For example, with just two lines of HTML, you can add a sign-in button to your application that authenticates an Azure AD user and then displays their profile photo and name.

    **Beautiful but Flexible**

    The components are designed to look and feel like Microsoft365 experiences, but are also customizable. You can style the components using CSS custom properties to match the look of the components to your branding and use custom templates to modify the content of any component.
