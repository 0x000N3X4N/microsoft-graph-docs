# Microsoft Graph Toolkit

The Microsoft Graph Toolkit is a collection of reusable, framework-agnostic web components and helpers for accessing and working with Microsoft Graph. All components can access Microsoft Graph without any customization required.

The Microsoft Graph Toolkit is great for any developer looking to create a web app, Teams Tab, or SharePoint web part that makes calls to Microsoft Graph. By providing UI components that are designed to look and feel like Microsoft 365 experiences, the Toolkit reduces your time and cost to integrate with our platform. All of the UI components authenticate with and access data from Microsoft Graph out of box. The components are fully customizable using CSS and templating, enabling you to match your unique branding and to control the content displayed in the components.
